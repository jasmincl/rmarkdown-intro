</div>


<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "left", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("meme_educatedaf.png", auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", FALSE), 
    dpi = NULL)
```
</div>

## My first Podcast - Episode
- My first podcast: Meetup-reporting last year
- *Approach*: Just ask random people, get a bunch of audios and then cut them together so it fits
- Probably not the best approach :D
- Future: Plan better, especially if you interview more people

## Data Science in der Praxis Episodes
- Better planning, send questions to participant beforehand
- Conversation mostly follows these questions but it is more a conversation than a planned script
- Edit video & send to interview partner for review

## Software: Audacity
- Free & open-source audio software
- import ```.mp4``` files & edit them
- export to ```.mp4```
- very good & complex software, so far I only use the basics
- [Link](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

## What I learned so far
- You can always edit out things
- You can rerecord your own voice
- BUT: usually sound circumstances are different once you edit 
- Be careful there is no background noise (small stuff matters! E.g. tapping the table while talking)

## Challenges
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

- User numbers go down
- How to do marketing right?
- Adjust contents? More about topics?
</div>

```

## Future Ideas / Shows
- New Show that is more thematic (about Data Science / Programming topics)

## Music / Intro - Jingle
